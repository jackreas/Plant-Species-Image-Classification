# Plant Species Image Classification Project

## A. Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an image classification model for 20 different plant species. The model is designed to accurately identify each plant species from images, aiding in botanical research, plant identification, and educational purposes.

**Purpose of the Model:**  
- Automatically classify plant species from images.  
- Assist researchers and hobbyists in plant identification.  
- Provide a foundation for future plant recognition applications.

## B. Plant Species Section

Below are the 20 plant species included in this project. Each entry includes a representative image, common name, scientific name (if available), and a brief description.

| Image | Common Name | Scientific Name | Description |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| ![Plant1](path/to/image1.jpg) | Example Plant 1 | *Scientific Name 1* | Brief description of the plant species. |
| ![Plant2](path/to/image2.jpg) | Example Plant 2 | *Scientific Name 2* | Brief description of the plant species. |
| ![Plant3](path/to/image3.jpg) | Example Plant 3 | *Scientific Name 3* | Brief description of the plant species. |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

> Repeat the table for all 20 species. Replace `path/to/imageX.jpg` with actual image paths.

## C. Model Training Details

The image classification model was trained using the following parameters:

- **Epochs:** 50  
- **Batch Size:** 32  
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001  
- **Number of Images per Class:** 200  

> Adjust values to match your actual training configuration.
